| [[world/history/0 - The Collapse\|0 - The Collapse]]             | 000  | News arrived slowly from the survivors of the Southern continent, my brother, a king in a distant land was now the avatar of the God of [[world/pantheon/Avarice\|Avarice]]. The Gods had always had their games of folly and violence, throwing one tribe against another. Tribes eventually became kingdoms and now whole continents war and tear themselves a sunder. Two evenings ago, I watched as the horizon glowed with ephemeral green stars that dove from the heavens and the sky erupted in green and reds, millions of people lost, for what? Recently a third God had joined the war. The God of [[world/pantheon/Strife\|Mercy]], his followers called him, but we called him [[world/pantheon/Strife\|Strife]]. The only mercy his acolytes ever applied was the swiftness of death to all who followed the other two gods, [[world/pantheon/Avarice\|Avarice]] and [[world/pantheon/Pandemonium\|Pandemonium]].<br><br>A sending stone arrives connected to the south. 'The city of [[world/locations/Vinetta\|Vinetta]] burns, something is wrong with the land, it turns to ash, the lakes have boiled away', a scream ends the message. I turn to my fellow council members and their faces do not hide their concern, we all know we're the last free kingdom. Away from the games but their eternal eyes will turn on us now, it is only a matter of time. [[world/npcs/Sirico\|Sirico]], a tall elven council woman, is the first to break the silence, '[[world/npcs/Dez\|Dez]], it's time we seek out a God of our own, we can't survive without them, maybe they can shelter us', she pleads, and I turn from my friends, they will soon know my shame. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] answers before the truth escapes my lips, 'We are the broken, we formed this coalition to stand apart from the pretender Gods and I’ll be damned if we go begging for their benevolence now’ his low dwarvern voice echoes off the walls. I look around at the rest of our council and know we are doomed. There is open scorn for his words. We are at the end of our nation, and we are desperate for a way to avoid the coming calamity. <br><br>‘I have been to the gates’; my words hang in the room, and I see [[world/npcs/Sirico\|Sirico]] barely hide a smirk. ‘So, our paragon of freedom has given in, don’t you see that we were always just dirt under their feet. If we don’t play their game then we are nothing but another sandfort to topple as they play at war’, [[world/npcs/Sirico\|Sirico]] smiles as she lets her words sit with the council and she knows she is vindicated. I must continue, I must be the saviour they think I am. I will not be my brother. <br><br>‘[[world/npcs/Sirico\|Sirico]], you were right but now is not the time for gloating. At the gate to the God’s home, I begged for them to help us, there must be one who will oppose the three. I think I heard whimpering but there is no safety there for us, no heroes, we are all there is’. Our sorcerers and wizards are failing, without clerics to support us we will soon be visible to them. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] doesn’t meet my eyes. I have failed him, and he will never forgive me. <br><br>We argue into the small hours of the night, and I am almost sure I see the slow advancement of that glow in the skies. Our last three days continued in this cycle, the council debating ways to survive as our proctors patrol the city ensuring some semblance of peace. <br><br>On the 26th hour of the third day, as the second moon rises our table begins to glow. A dainty figure rises from a glowing pool of brilliant white light. The goddess of [[world/pantheon/Balance\|Balance]]. ‘Mortals, I can not save you from them, we left them to their own machinations for too long, and we have doomed this world’ her voice is ragged, her eyes hollow, the gods have fallen and there are only remnants of their purported glory. ‘There may be something we can do’, my eyes dart across the table, ‘We?’ her shoulder glows a soft pink light almost in answer to my question. Upon her shoulder is a tiny person, smaller yet than a pixie. ‘This is [[world/pantheon/Fate\|Jihlea]], you call her [[world/pantheon/Fate\|Fate]], I have managed to reawaken them from their slumber, and together I believe we can…’, the room shakes, and we know the end is here. <br><br>Three avatars of Gods have arrived to claim this city as their final conquest, their colossal forms in the distance, [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] has used some sorcery to transform the stone walls into glass so we can observe our demise. Balance flits through the air to survey the situation and lands back on the table silently. ‘As I was saying, together we can save some of you’, they seem to melt into one another and form into a goliath sized being. ‘We know of a long dead world, it is a world you can shape into something new, away from them, whatever was there before is long perished or abandoned.’ <br><br>They explain their plan to transport us to this new world, we have two hours to gather supplies, the council disseminates this to their wards and soon the city is a flurry of panic and packing. Glyphs begin to glow on seemingly random spaces across the city, [[world/pantheon/Balance\|Balance]] told us that each one could move groups  of people. Bags of holding are crammed with parchments, books, scrolls, potions and more. Farmers usher their livestock to the glyphs in preparation. <br><br>Two hours could never be enough time, but we make do and portals begin to open as most of our city set eyes on the verdant hills covered in a [[Dahlia\|strange flower]] we’ve never seen, this is to be our new home. We step through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Sometimes even a dwarf could be impressed by the ability to build a city with magic, he'd ensured his peers had added the right finishing touches to the city, the stone might be magic but it was still stone.<br><br>Each octant is split by canals, all meeting at the centre of [[world/locations/Rovnováha/Rovnováha\|Rovnováha]], their new home. And in the middle of those eight canals a seemingly endless source of water flowing down the onyx slate. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] had etched the names of their fallen cities himself, each a distant memory of a land long turned to ash. Along the top of the slate reads 'As long as [[world/locations/Rovnováha/Rovnováha\|Rovnováha]] stands, we will not forget the lost'. Around the base grew the strange flowers they encountered upon their arrival, a flower crowned with hundreds of petals, the [[Dahlia\|dahlia]].<br><br>[[world/npcs/Sirico\|Sirico]] approached [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] and coughed to avoid startling him. 'It is time, the others wait for us. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]], do you really think it wise to let splinters of this nation go and claim their own cities?'. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]]'s brow furrowed, 'We are a city of refugees, with the city construction finally complete, it is only natural for us to begin spreading out, some do not wish to live under the council's rule and we can not stop them'. [[world/npcs/Sirico\|Sirico]] tensed her fist and in a moment her rage seems to dissipate. '[[world/npcs/Dez\|Dez]] will turn against us, I know it, he is not the man we knew, he will bring back the crown and name himself king'. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] looks at his friend and sees the hatred in her eyes for [[world/npcs/Dez\|Dez]], the elf can barely control herself anymore. 'My friend, we may not know him anymore but he would not bring war to this world, let him go and play at wearing a crown in a castle, we have outgrown our new city and it is time for us to spread out'.

It always made him feel better to start the day cleaning, a habit formed after years of careful construction. First clean the windows, followed by the tables, chairs, glasses, leaving the bar till last. He glanced up from his work at the empty quest board on the wall opposite and sighed. Rumours had been hard to come by as of late, usually something or other would be going on, rodent problems, familiars behaving strangely, a jealous ex spouse wishing to steal their former lovers prized possession. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] shrugged, turning to the sink to wring out the now somewhat sticky cloth, perhaps that was the price of moving to a peaceful town like [[world/locations/Elysia Vale/Elysia Vale\|Elysia Vale]]. Back in [[world/locations/Rovnováha/Rovnováha\|Rovnováha]] the tavern was never empty with many disgruntled travellers and locals, bearing their souls and wishes to him.<br>“Daddy!” The cry of excitement came from the bottom of the winding staircase, [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] smiled at his daughter. Her hazel eyes wide as she grinned from ear to ear, quickly traversing through the chairs and tables to the bar. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] left the rag in the sink, exiting the bar to meet her, scooping her gently into his arms. <br>“A very good morning to you sweetheart.” Planting a kiss on her cheek which made her giggle, “what have you got planned for today?” <br>“Mama’s going to take me to the market and then we’re going to go to the bakery for a treat.” Her delicate hands playing with his dark hair as she spoke, twirling it round her small fingers. He untangled her hand from his hair and kissed her palm, making her giggle again. He loved that sound. <br>“Sounds like you’ve got a busy day ahead of you, are you ready for your adventure?” <br>“Yes!” <br>As if on cue, the figure of his wife appeared in the doorway, a basket of freshly cut dahlias on her arm. <br>“Good morning love” she said, smiling, placing the flowers in an empty bottle that sat at the end of the bar, “I thought they would brighten the place, don’t you agree [[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]]?” <br>[[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]] had wriggled out of his arms, standing on tip toes to reach the height of the bar, “they’re wonderful. Daddy! Come look!” <br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] chuckled softly, heeding his daughter’s words, he made his way around the bar to his wife. Kissing her cheek, “they’re lovely [[world/npcs/Elaine\|Elaine]], thank you.” <br>[[world/npcs/Elaine\|Elaine]] met his gaze with her sparkling green eyes, her long blonde hair tied back in a plait that fell down the length of her back. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] suddenly felt thankful that [[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]] was practically a carbon copy of his wife in every way. His own dark hair and eyes having little influence on his daughter’s appearance except for the flecks of brown in her wide eyes. <br>“Right young lady, we have much to do today and better leave your father to mix drinks in peace!” [[world/npcs/Elaine\|Elaine]] outstretched her hand towards [[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]] who happily took it, and led her to the front door, waving her free hand in farewell. And then they were gone, the sound of [[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]]’s chatter fading slowly into calm. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] sighed, the remnants of the joy still written on his face as he returned to the bar, the bottles clanking loudly as he sorted them. <br><br>The bell’s ringing echoed, a tall figure with a lanky frame entered, his hands decorated with rings of various sizes, wearing a robe of dark blue and silver. <br>“Morning barkeep.” He waved a hand and took a seat at the bar, tapping his fingers against its surface. <br>“How many times do I need to say, please call me [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Ted]].” <br>The elf smiled, his teeth pearly white, brushing his long hair behind his shoulders, “ah yes, old habits die hard I suppose.” <br>“What can I get you [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]]?” <br>[[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] put a thoughtful hand to his chin, surveying the various coloured and sized bottles standing on the shelf. <br>“Could you make me something that would help with moving the latest addition to my collection?” <br>“You found another?” [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] asked, his curiosity piqued, [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] had been investigating and collecting what could only be described as ruined artefacts, often found scattered across the continent. The remnants of the civilisation, dubbed the [[world/cultures/Eeshan\|Eeshan]], that inhabited these lands and had since died out before the collapse.<br>“Indeed. Unfortunately it’s rather large and I don’t trust anyone else to handle it.” <br>“I’ll see what I can do.” <br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] turned away from [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]], muttering to himself as he grabbed bottles of red and blue, alongside some green leaves which he plucked from a nearby potted plant. Mixing it all together in a tall glass, the resulting liquid a swirling purple. <br>“This should do the trick.” He said, serving it to [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] who eyed it with curiosity. <br>“Thank you.” [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] took a long sip from the glass, placing it back down with a little more force than expected.<br><br>The bell sang for the second time that morning, a plump woman with rosey cheeks stepped over the threshold, her auburn beard was neatly woven so as not to obscure the gold emblem on her chest. <br>“Hiya [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Ted]]! ” She greeted warmly as she walked up to the bar and promptly collapsed on a nearby stool, noticing [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] with some surprise, “I didn’t think I’d see you here at this early hour, especially with all the talk of the temple ruins found last night.”<br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] saw [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] twitch, clearly trying to suppress his excitement before it burst from him in the form of a lecture, [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] quickly turned to his new patron, “morning [[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]], what can I get for you?” <br>Her brown eyes brightened at the gesture, “all this temple business is doing my head in, if I could have something that will help answer all the never ending questions I would be most grateful.” <br>“Coming right up.” [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] replied, relieved to turn away as [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] finally launched into a speech about his theories about the [[world/cultures/Eeshan\|Eeshan]] temple. He set to work on collecting the components of [[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]]’s drink request, red, orange and yellow liquid filled the squat glass, laying on top of one another like a sunrise. Pleased with the outcome, [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] reached under the bar and pulled out a fine crystal, crushing it in his palm and dusting it around the rim of the glass before handing it over to [[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]], who had now been dragged into a lively discussion. <br>“The [[world/cultures/Eeshan\|Eeshan]] were way more advanced than our current society. The more we find, the more likely we’ll be able to harness the same power, don’t you think?” <br>[[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]] had just enough time to grunt in agreement before [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] continued, “just imagine the possibilities! If we could replicate any of the technology they had, it would be highly beneficial! Pray tell, what do you know of the temple?” <br>[[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]] took the opportunity to drain her glass before answering, “not much, the place is overrun, needs to be cleared prior to any exploration.” <br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] observed [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]]’s face fall, his fingers starting to spin one of his rings around his finger. <br>“Anyone volunteered?” [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] cleared his throat, stepping into the conversation seamlessly. <br>“Not as of yet, not many want to leave the safety of the vale.” <br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]]’s gaze fell on the empty quest board, “how about I put an advert up in here, any passer by would see it and perhaps accept the task.” <br>[[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]]’s face beamed, “what a splendid idea, I’ll leave it in your very capable hands [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Ted]].” She dropped down to the floor with a thump, “thank you for the drink, I feel it working already.” <br>"Take care.” [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] waved farewell, looking back towards [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] who was staring at the quest board with some curiosity. <br>“Do you also have something in need of taking care of?” <br>[[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] snapped his gaze back to [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]], his purple eyes alight with elation, “as I cannot yet travel to the temple, I’d better test the security of my current collection’s home. I usually do it myself but I know all the tricks, so I don’t actually know how good of a security system it is. Do you think you could appeal to some wandering adventurers?” <br>“Of course my friend, I’ll post it next to [[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]]'s.” <br>“Excellent, I will wait with bated breath. Until next time barkeep [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Ted]].” He tipped his head in thanks and swept out of the tavern, with a new spring in his step. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] chuckled, shaking his head in earnest, this town wasn’t short of eccentric characters, he thought. Leaning down behind the bar for a quill and parchment, writing out the two quests, and pinning them on the once empty board, next to each other as promised: “[[world/quests/Legal Larceny\|Legal Larceny]]”, “[[world/quests/Trouble at Temple Ruins\|Trouble at Temple Ruins]].” <br>Pleased with his work, he returned to the bar, each hour creeping slowly as he awaited the next patron to walk through his doors. |
