# Dhemis
God of Cunning and Magic, a master of wit, strategy and dabbling in arcane manipulation. A deity thriving in the shadows hiding behind his talents of intellect and deception. Dhemis wields magic with precision, using it to outthink, outmaneuver, and influence those susceptible to his talents. His domain spans not only cleverness and trickery but also the deeper, hidden aspects of magic wielding and arcane knowledge
