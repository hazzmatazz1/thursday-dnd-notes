He was here, but he was not from here. 

A state of being. A state of mind. 

He often sat alone staring at an object which caught the light as he slowly turned it in his long, almost delicate fingers, his watery blue eyes lulled and languid, illuminated by the turning object on which they were fixed

A silver coin. An old habit. 

His hair was long and black, framing angular features, skin pale in the shadowed corner he occupied, back to a wall, facing the door. 

He looked old, but only in a way that only the young can, when they consider the world as a series of inconveniences and frustrations uniquely set to fraught their manifest destiny. 

You would judge him to be treading carefully out of his youth and into a hard earned middle age. 

When he looked up and surveyed the room at large his face had a feigned disinterest to it, open, in a carefully polished mask he had learned to settle on his features

When he spoke, his voice was slow and measured, his tone even, assuming a tone of politeness and gentility that made one wonder at the shabbiness of his clothing. 

A man falling, or perhaps a man climbing, using stolen verbal tools to do so. 

Almost a man pretending to be someone he knew once, long ago, and far away. 

Or perhaps remembering to be himself in a fashion that would not be familiar to others

Even to himself. 

His sharp features were not unattractive, pleasant even, when the mind behind them settled into a passive state

But there were times when unbidden thoughts freed fleeting flashes of imprisoned passions that caused those features to shift into a less pleasant configuration, the mobile blue eyes becoming chill, the set of mouth curdling into sneers and pouts. 

He sat alone mostly, there was not much that invited company, even if the eyes and sudden smiles seemed to counter that notion. 

He seemed someone familiar with the concept of friendliness, but only from having read about it in a story from his childhood. 

A fighting man, judging by his equipment and armour, tall and rangy, long arms and legs, the strength of the clinging vines on the stable wall rather than that of the bull in the field

Occasionally he seemed to catch the sight of his weapons out the corner of those darting eyes and a brief look of incredulous surprise would disturb the placidity on that pale countenance, chased away by a small moue of distaste moment later. 

It was almost as if he wondered who it was that was so disrespectful to leave such a sharp object so close to his hand in such polite company!

An unwelcome acquaintance here to announce embarrassing accusations  of former impropriaty. 

But those that watched on would notice that same hand would caress that same weapon with  the absent familiarity which only came from muscle memory. 

If an occasion presented itself where his name was called on to be disclosed during casual conversation the narrow face became pinched and guarded, the eyes slid sideways to wander aimlessly around the room whilst he considered the appropriate response

Seconds of careful consideration, checks and balances tallied in an internal book of cascading risk evaluation would eventually produce a response in that cultured, modulated voice. 

“[[Ebit Da\|Ebit Da]], consider me to be at your service”

He would nod to himself, turning the sound around in his mouth, pursed and serious, as if testing it for hazard before he swallowed the sound again. 

Yes, that nod seemed to say, yes that is my name, and so it is so

I remember, it is me, it is who I am, and it is all that I have of value in the world!

Just so

And his mouth would stretch into a thin smile that did not quite touch his wintery blue eyes and he would extend his long fingered hand to take yours without enthusiasm. 

“Just so, hmmm?”
