[[world/characters/Osbyn\|Osbyn]],
It is more worrying than I ever dared imagine. They are calling them The [[world/cultures/Eeshan\|Eeshan]], a lost civilisation that once walked upon the same hills and vales as we do now.  Who knows, perhaps they too played beneath the dappled shade of the [[Wipplewood\|Wipplewood]] or fished along the banks of the [[Kettle Berry\|Kettle Berry]] as we did not so very long ago. Yet, what horrors befell those who dwelt here long before our forebears fled the cinders of the Old World? Dare we allow the same mistakes again; bring ruin to the land anew?
Ruins and artefacts that should have been left where they lay have been unearthed and there is now talk of a temple.
They speak so passionately of technology and of harnessing ancient power unknown yet they ignore the simplicity of nature and the beauty before them. [[world/pantheon/Ota\|Ota]]â€™s Oath [[world/characters/Osbyn\|Osbyn]], I need your help. They are calling for hired swords in [[world/locations/Vasilius/Elysia Vale/Elysia Vale\|Elysia Vale]]. I will meet you there if I can.
