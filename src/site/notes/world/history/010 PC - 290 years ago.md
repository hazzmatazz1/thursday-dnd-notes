# 010 PC - 290 years ago
(description::[[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] stood at the top of [[world/locations/Rovnováha/The Citadel\|the citadel]], a huge tower hundreds of feet high, surveying the kingdom they carved out from their new world, the collapse was a decade ago. Sometimes even a dwarf could be impressed by the ability to build a city with magic, he'd ensured his peers had added the right finishing touches to the city, the stone might be magic but it was still stone.<br><br>Each octant is split by canals, all meeting at the centre of [[world/locations/Rovnováha/Rovnováha\|Rovnováha]], their new home. And in the middle of those eight canals a seemingly endless source of water flowing down the onyx slate. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] had etched the names of their fallen cities himself, each a distant memory of a land long turned to ash. Along the top of the slate reads 'As long as [[world/locations/Rovnováha/Rovnováha\|Rovnováha]] stands, we will not forget the lost'. Around the base grew the strange flowers they encountered upon their arrival, a flower crowned with hundreds of petals, the [[Dahlia\|dahlia]].<br><br>[[world/npcs/Sirico\|Sirico]] approached [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] and coughed to avoid startling him. 'It is time, the others wait for us. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]], do you really think it wise to let splinters of this nation go and claim their own cities?'. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]]'s brow furrowed, 'We are a city of refugees, with the city construction finally complete, it is only natural for us to begin spreading out, some do not wish to live under the council's rule and we can not stop them'. [[world/npcs/Sirico\|Sirico]] tensed her fist and in a moment her rage seems to dissipate. '[[world/npcs/Dez\|Dez]] will turn against us, I know it, he is not the man we knew, he will bring back the crown and name himself king'. [[world/npcs/Cal\|Cal]] looks at his friend and sees the hatred in her eyes for [[world/npcs/Dez\|Dez]], the elf can barely control herself anymore. 'My friend, we may not know him anymore but he would not bring war to this world, let him go and play at wearing a crown in a castle, we have outgrown our new city and it is time for us to spread out'.)
