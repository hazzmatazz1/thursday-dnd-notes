# 300 PC - The Beginning
(description::[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] was wiping down the bar, his nose wrinkled at the smell of stale drink from the night before. It always made him feel better to start the day cleaning, a habit formed after years of careful construction. First clean the windows, followed by the tables, chairs, glasses, leaving the bar till last. He glanced up from his work at the empty quest board on the wall opposite and sighed. Rumours had been hard to come by as of late, usually something or other would be going on, rodent problems, familiars behaving strangely, a jealous ex spouse wishing to steal their former lovers prized possession. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] shrugged, turning to the sink to wring out the now somewhat sticky cloth, perhaps that was the price of moving to a peaceful town like [[world/locations/Elysia Vale/Elysia Vale\|Elysia Vale]]. Back in [[world/locations/Rovnováha/Rovnováha\|Rovnováha]] the tavern was never empty with many disgruntled travellers and locals, bearing their souls and wishes to him.<br>“Daddy!” The cry of excitement came from the bottom of the winding staircase, [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] smiled at his daughter. Her hazel eyes wide as she grinned from ear to ear, quickly traversing through the chairs and tables to the bar. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] left the rag in the sink, exiting the bar to meet her, scooping her gently into his arms. <br>“A very good morning to you sweetheart.” Planting a kiss on her cheek which made her giggle, “what have you got planned for today?” <br>“Mama’s going to take me to the market and then we’re going to go to the bakery for a treat.” Her delicate hands playing with his dark hair as she spoke, twirling it round her small fingers. He untangled her hand from his hair and kissed her palm, making her giggle again. He loved that sound. <br>“Sounds like you’ve got a busy day ahead of you, are you ready for your adventure?” <br>“Yes!” <br>As if on cue, the figure of his wife appeared in the doorway, a basket of freshly cut dahlias on her arm. <br>“Good morning love” she said, smiling, placing the flowers in an empty bottle that sat at the end of the bar, “I thought they would brighten the place, don’t you agree [[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]]?” <br>[[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]] had wriggled out of his arms, standing on tip toes to reach the height of the bar, “they’re wonderful. Daddy! Come look!” <br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] chuckled softly, heeding his daughter’s words, he made his way around the bar to his wife. Kissing her cheek, “they’re lovely [[world/npcs/Elaine\|Elaine]], thank you.” <br>[[world/npcs/Elaine\|Elaine]] met his gaze with her sparkling green eyes, her long blonde hair tied back in a plait that fell down the length of her back. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] suddenly felt thankful that [[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]] was practically a carbon copy of his wife in every way. His own dark hair and eyes having little influence on his daughter’s appearance except for the flecks of brown in her wide eyes. <br>“Right young lady, we have much to do today and better leave your father to mix drinks in peace!” [[world/npcs/Elaine\|Elaine]] outstretched her hand towards [[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]] who happily took it, and led her to the front door, waving her free hand in farewell. And then they were gone, the sound of [[world/npcs/Constance\|Constance]]’s chatter fading slowly into calm. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] sighed, the remnants of the joy still written on his face as he returned to the bar, the bottles clanking loudly as he sorted them. <br><br>The bell’s ringing echoed, a tall figure with a lanky frame entered, his hands decorated with rings of various sizes, wearing a robe of dark blue and silver. <br>“Morning barkeep.” He waved a hand and took a seat at the bar, tapping his fingers against its surface. <br>“How many times do I need to say, please call me [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Ted]].” <br>The elf smiled, his teeth pearly white, brushing his long hair behind his shoulders, “ah yes, old habits die hard I suppose.” <br>“What can I get you [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]]?” <br>[[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] put a thoughtful hand to his chin, surveying the various coloured and sized bottles standing on the shelf. <br>“Could you make me something that would help with moving the latest addition to my collection?” <br>“You found another?” [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] asked, his curiosity piqued, [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] had been investigating and collecting what could only be described as ruined artefacts, often found scattered across the continent. The remnants of the civilisation, dubbed the [[world/cultures/Eeshan\|Eeshan]], that inhabited these lands and had since died out before the collapse.<br>“Indeed. Unfortunately it’s rather large and I don’t trust anyone else to handle it.” <br>“I’ll see what I can do.” <br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] turned away from [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]], muttering to himself as he grabbed bottles of red and blue, alongside some green leaves which he plucked from a nearby potted plant. Mixing it all together in a tall glass, the resulting liquid a swirling purple. <br>“This should do the trick.” He said, serving it to [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] who eyed it with curiosity. <br>“Thank you.” [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] took a long sip from the glass, placing it back down with a little more force than expected.<br><br>The bell sang for the second time that morning, a plump woman with rosey cheeks stepped over the threshold, her auburn beard was neatly woven so as not to obscure the gold emblem on her chest. <br>“Hiya [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Ted]]! ” She greeted warmly as she walked up to the bar and promptly collapsed on a nearby stool, noticing [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] with some surprise, “I didn’t think I’d see you here at this early hour, especially with all the talk of the temple ruins found last night.”<br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] saw [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] twitch, clearly trying to suppress his excitement before it burst from him in the form of a lecture, [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] quickly turned to his new patron, “morning [[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]], what can I get for you?” <br>Her brown eyes brightened at the gesture, “all this temple business is doing my head in, if I could have something that will help answer all the never ending questions I would be most grateful.” <br>“Coming right up.” [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] replied, relieved to turn away as [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] finally launched into a speech about his theories about the [[world/cultures/Eeshan\|Eeshan]] temple. He set to work on collecting the components of [[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]]’s drink request, red, orange and yellow liquid filled the squat glass, laying on top of one another like a sunrise. Pleased with the outcome, [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] reached under the bar and pulled out a fine crystal, crushing it in his palm and dusting it around the rim of the glass before handing it over to [[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]], who had now been dragged into a lively discussion. <br>“The [[world/cultures/Eeshan\|Eeshan]] were way more advanced than our current society. The more we find, the more likely we’ll be able to harness the same power, don’t you think?” <br>[[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]] had just enough time to grunt in agreement before [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] continued, “just imagine the possibilities! If we could replicate any of the technology they had, it would be highly beneficial! Pray tell, what do you know of the temple?” <br>[[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]] took the opportunity to drain her glass before answering, “not much, the place is overrun, needs to be cleared prior to any exploration.” <br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] observed [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]]’s face fall, his fingers starting to spin one of his rings around his finger. <br>“Anyone volunteered?” [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] cleared his throat, stepping into the conversation seamlessly. <br>“Not as of yet, not many want to leave the safety of the vale.” <br>[[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]]’s gaze fell on the empty quest board, “how about I put an advert up in here, any passer by would see it and perhaps accept the task.” <br>[[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]]’s face beamed, “what a splendid idea, I’ll leave it in your very capable hands [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Ted]].” She dropped down to the floor with a thump, “thank you for the drink, I feel it working already.” <br>"Take care.” [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] waved farewell, looking back towards [[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] who was staring at the quest board with some curiosity. <br>“Do you also have something in need of taking care of?” <br>[[world/npcs/Hex\|Hex]] snapped his gaze back to [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]], his purple eyes alight with elation, “as I cannot yet travel to the temple, I’d better test the security of my current collection’s home. I usually do it myself but I know all the tricks, so I don’t actually know how good of a security system it is. Do you think you could appeal to some wandering adventurers?” <br>“Of course my friend, I’ll post it next to [[world/npcs/Solmura\|Solmura]]'s.” <br>“Excellent, I will wait with bated breath. Until next time barkeep [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Ted]].” He tipped his head in thanks and swept out of the tavern, with a new spring in his step. [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]] chuckled, shaking his head in earnest, this town wasn’t short of eccentric characters, he thought. Leaning down behind the bar for a quill and parchment, writing out the two quests, and pinning them on the once empty board, next to each other as promised: “[[world/quests/Legal Larceny\|Legal Larceny]]”, “[[world/quests/Trouble at Temple Ruins\|Trouble at Temple Ruins]].” <br>Pleased with his work, he returned to the bar, each hour creeping slowly as he awaited the next patron to walk through his doors.)
