# Elysia Vale
A vibrant town nestled around a large oasis, with vividly painted buildings adorned with intricate flower carvings, cobbled streets draped in colorful garments, and the air filled with the scents of fresh herbs and baked goods from bustling markets.
# Overview
Over the three hundred years the [[Dahlia\|strange flowers]] spread across the continent, the main city as its centre. As the population grew and spread, some chose to follow the path of the [[Dahlia\|dahlias]] that lead away from [[world/locations/Rovnováha/Rovnováha\|Rovnováha]]. One such path followed the southern most canal which became a river, winding across the countryside of what was once unoccupied land. The river found its destination in a large oasis, surrounded by fields of dahlias where a town in the south was founded, Elysia Vale.

The buildings of the vale are vividly painted, carefully decorated with intricate carvings and depictions of the flowers that surround it. Colourful garments hang across the cobbled streets creating a kaleidoscopic paradise for those who live here. The smell of fresh herbs and baked goods permeate the air from the busy markets. Children laugh and run around the square trailing brightly coloured ribbons behind them. Life was simple here, wealth was divided and shared, farmland carefully tended to and over the years became a haven for many. This is where our adventure begins.
