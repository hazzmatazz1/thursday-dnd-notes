# Session 001 - Trouble at Temple Ruins
Played on: 2025-01-23T00:00:00.000+00:00
# Summary
In the [[world/locations/Vasilius/Elysia Vale/Stonehill Tavern\|Stonehill Tavern]] of [[world/locations/Vasilius/Elysia Vale/Elysia Vale\|Elysia Vale]], our adventure kicked off with a notice seeking help for a temple discovery in the mines. I introduced myself to fellow adventurers [[world/characters/Benbo\|Benbo]], [[world/characters/Dorwen\|Dorwen]], [[world/characters/Osbyn\|Osbyn]], and [[world/characters/Amoss\|Amoss]], and after some bonding over drinks, we set off south towards the mines. En route, we discovered an abandoned wagon with blood and goblin tracks. Despite [[world/characters/Amoss\|Amoss]]'s concerns, we decided to follow the tracks, leading to a skirmish with goblins. We emerged victorious but not unscathed, finding among the goblins' spoils the bodies of a horse and a young woman from town. We laid the woman's body in the wagon before continuing our journey. As night fell, [[world/characters/Benbo\|Benbo]] and [[world/characters/Dorwen\|Dorwen]] took watch, giving me a chance to sleep.

# Notes
- We begin in the [[world/locations/Vasilius/Elysia Vale/Stonehill Tavern\|Stonehill Tavern]] in [[world/locations/Vasilius/Elysia Vale/Elysia Vale\|Elysia Vale]]. In the tavern there is a notice asking for help in the mines as they have found the remains of an [[world/cultures/Eeshan\|Eeshan]] temple. This is [[world/quests/Trouble at Temple Ruins\|Trouble at Temple Ruins]].
- In the tavern with me are several others, adventurers by the looks of things:
	- [[world/characters/Benbo\|Benbo]], a wood elf ranger
	- [[world/characters/Dorwen\|Dorwen]], a rock gnome ranger from [[world/locations/Vasilius/Barleydeep\|Barleydeep]]
	- [[world/characters/Osbyn\|Osbyn]], a halfling druid from [[world/locations/Vasilius/Brambledown\|Brambledown]]
	- [[world/characters/Amoss\|Amoss]], a human fighter
- I have never met these people before, so decide it best to introduce myself to everyone and bring everyone together.
- We seem to get on okay, [[world/characters/Benbo\|Benbo]] seems wise, a bit like my grandfather. [[world/characters/Amoss\|Amoss]] seems very closed off and standoffish, but I bet he's a big teddy bear under all that armour once we get to know him better.
- [[world/characters/Osbyn\|Osbyn]] told us he is expecting to meet someone here at the tavern before we set off, so he buys us a round of fine ale from [[world/npcs/Theodore\|Theodore]].
- [[world/characters/Amoss\|Amoss]] seems to want to leave to find a "whore" but there are no whores in [[world/locations/Vasilius/Elysia Vale/Elysia Vale\|Elysia Vale]], its too small of a town for that.
- [[world/characters/Dorwen\|Dorwen]] tells me he doesn't like [[world/locations/Vasilius/Elysia Vale/Elysia Vale\|Elysia Vale]], I don't know why its amazing here
- After our round of drinks, [[world/characters/Osbyn\|Osbyn]] decides his friend isn't coming, and we set out south towards the mines. I know they are around 20 miles away, so will be a couple days of walking.
- We chat a bit down the road, where people are from etc.
- Eventually we stumble across a wagon, it looks abandoned and broken. There are no signs of animals to pull the wagon around.
- We approach and see the wagon is filled with empty barrels that have been cracked open, and pools of blood on the floor and drivers seat. We also see a streak of blood leading out into the field and over a hill. 
- There are footprints here, [[world/characters/Dorwen\|Dorwen]] and [[world/characters/Benbo\|Benbo]] identify them as Goblin footprints.
- We argue over whether we should follow the tracks, myself, [[world/characters/Benbo\|Benbo]], [[world/characters/Osbyn\|Osbyn]] and [[world/characters/Dorwen\|Dorwen]] all think its the right thing to do, in case there is someone we can save. [[world/characters/Amoss\|Amoss]] believes that its a waste of time, something we are risking our lives for and not getting paid.
- We ultimately decide to follow the tracks, with [[world/characters/Dorwen\|Dorwen]] taking a non-cautious lead.
- As he crests the hill, he sees and hears a group of goblins below, who are talking. As he was not being cautious, they hear and spot him. Combat ensues.
- Arrows are fired, goblins are killed. We take some heavy damage, with [[world/characters/Osbyn\|Osbyn]] nearly being felled, however we come out on top. [[world/characters/Amoss\|Amoss]] is a good fighter, strong and tactical.
- The goblins don't have anything of worth on them, and there is no sign of the missing shipment. We do find the bodies of a horse, and a young woman. I recognise her as an employee at the provisions store, new to town so I do not know her well.
- While we were investigating the young woman and horse, [[world/characters/Amoss\|Amoss]] was piling up the goblins, and setting their bodies on fire. He also took all of their ears to sell as a reward.
- [[world/characters/Benbo\|Benbo]] decided to take the woman's body back to the wagon, and laid her there covered in a cloak. This would protect her from being eaten by crows, and if we come back this way we can take her body back to town, or notify someone of her location.
- We continue down the path for another hour or so, until it becomes dark. [[world/characters/Benbo\|Benbo]] and [[world/characters/Dorwen\|Dorwen]] take watch, and I sleep for the whole night.
