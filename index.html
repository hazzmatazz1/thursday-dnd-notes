<p dir="auto">News arrived slowly from the survivors of the Southern continent, my brother, a king in a distant land was now the avatar of the God of <a data-href="Avarice" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Avarice</a>. The Gods had always had their games of folly and violence, throwing one tribe against another. Tribes eventually became kingdoms and now whole continents war and tear themselves a sunder. Two evenings ago, I watched as the horizon glowed with ephemeral green stars that dove from the heavens and the sky erupted in green and reds, millions of people lost, for what? Recently a third God had joined the war. The God of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Strife" data-href="Strife" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Mercy</a>, his followers called him, but we called him <a data-href="Strife" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Strife</a>. The only mercy his acolytes ever applied was the swiftness of death to all who followed the other two gods, <a data-href="Avarice" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Avarice</a> and <a data-href="Pandemonium" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Pandemonium</a>.<br><br>A sending stone arrives connected to the south. 'The city of <a data-href="Vinetta" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Vinetta</a> burns, something is wrong with the land, it turns to ash, the lakes have boiled away', a scream ends the message. I turn to my fellow council members and their faces do not hide their concern, we all know we're the last free kingdom. Away from the games but their eternal eyes will turn on us now, it is only a matter of time. <a data-href="Sirico" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Sirico</a>, a tall elven council woman, is the first to break the silence, '<a data-href="Dez" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Dez</a>, it's time we seek out a God of our own, we can't survive without them, maybe they can shelter us', she pleads, and I turn from my friends, they will soon know my shame. <a data-href="Cal" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Cal</a> answers before the truth escapes my lips, 'We are the broken, we formed this coalition to stand apart from the pretender Gods and I’ll be damned if we go begging for their benevolence now’ his low dwarvern voice echoes off the walls. I look around at the rest of our council and know we are doomed. There is open scorn for his words. We are at the end of our nation, and we are desperate for a way to avoid the coming calamity. <br><br>‘I have been to the gates’; my words hang in the room, and I see <a data-href="Sirico" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Sirico</a> barely hide a smirk. ‘So, our paragon of freedom has given in, don’t you see that we were always just dirt under their feet.

Our sorcerers and wizards are failing, without clerics to support us we will soon be visible to them. <a data-href="Cal" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Cal</a> doesn’t meet my eyes.

Upon her shoulder is a tiny person, smaller yet than a pixie. ‘This is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Fate" data-href="Fate" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Jihlea</a>, you call her <a data-href="Fate" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Fate</a>, I have managed to reawaken them from their slumber, and together I believe we can…’, the room shakes, and we know the end is here. <br><br>Three avatars of Gods have arrived to claim this city as their final conquest, their colossal forms in the distance, <a data-href="Cal" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Cal</a> has used some sorcery to transform the stone walls into glass so we can observe our demise. Balance flits through the air to survey the situation and lands back on the table silently. ‘As I was saying, together we can save some of you’, they seem to melt into one another and form into a goliath sized being. ‘We know of a long dead world, it is a world you can shape into something new, away from them, whatever was there before is long perished or abandoned.’ <br><br>They explain their plan to transport us to this new world, we have two hours to gather supplies, the council disseminates this to their wards and soon the city is a flurry of panic and packing. Glyphs begin to glow on seemingly random spaces across the city, <a data-href="Balance" href="/404" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target rel="noopener nofollow">Balance</a> told us that each one could move groups of people. Bags of holding are crammed with parchments, books, scrolls, potions and more.

First clean the windows, followed by the tables, chairs, glasses, leaving the bar till last. He glanced up from his work at the empty quest board on the wall opposite and sighed.

Around the base grew the strange flowers they encountered upon their arrival, a flower crowned with hundreds of petals, the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">dahlia</a>.<br><br><a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Sirico</a> approached <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Cal</a> and coughed to avoid startling him. 'It is time, the others wait for us. <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Cal</a>, do you really think it wise to let splinters of this nation go and claim their own cities?'. <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Cal</a>'s brow furrowed, 'We are a city of refugees, with the city construction finally complete, it is only natural for us to begin spreading out, some do not wish to live under the council's rule and we can not stop them'. <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Sirico</a> tensed her fist and in a moment her rage seems to dissipate. '<a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Dez</a> will turn against us, I know it, he is not the man we knew, he will bring back the crown and name himself king'. <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Cal</a> looks at his friend and sees the hatred in her eyes for <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Dez</a>, the elf can barely control herself anymore. 'My friend, we may not know him anymore but he would not bring war to this world, let him go and play at wearing a crown in a castle, we have outgrown our new city and it is time for us to spread out'.</td>

<td><a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Theodore</a> was wiping down the bar, his nose wrinkled at the smell of stale drink from the night before. It always made him feel better to start the day cleaning, a habit formed after years of careful construction. First clean the windows, followed by the tables, chairs, glasses, leaving the bar till last. He glanced up from his work at the empty quest board on the wall opposite and sighed. Rumours had been hard to come by as of late, usually something or other would be going on, rodent problems, familiars behaving strangely, a jealous ex spouse wishing to steal their former lovers prized possession. <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Theodore</a> shrugged, turning to the sink to wring out the now somewhat sticky cloth, perhaps that was the price of moving to a peaceful town like <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Elysia Vale</a>. Back in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Rovnováha</a> the tavern was never empty with many disgruntled travellers and locals, bearing their souls and wishes to him.<br><br>“Daddy!” The cry of excitement came from the bottom of the winding staircase, <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Theodore</a> smiled at his daughter. Her hazel eyes wide as she grinned from ear to ear, quickly traversing through the chairs and tables to the bar. <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" href="/404" target="">Theodore</a> left the rag in the sink, exiting the bar to meet her, scooping her gently into his arms. <br><br>“A very good morning to you sweetheart.” Planting a kiss on her cheek which made her giggle, “what have you got planned for today?”</td>
